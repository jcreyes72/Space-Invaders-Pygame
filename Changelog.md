# Changes
## Overview
I ended up changing quite a few things to make the gameplay a bit better and UI a bit prettier. All in all, I think the gameplay is a bit better (though still not the best) and looks better too. If I had to change or add anything else, I would add a main menu, rework the game loop to run with a frame timer, and add more keybinds (like restart) to make gameplay easier. Maybe in the future.

## Gameplay
* Changed enemy move speed (from 4 to .5) to make them a more reasonable target to hit.
* Changed enemy Y spawn range (from 50-150 to 50-100) so they enemies would spawn a little higher on the scren.

## UI/UX
* Edited enemy image to have a clear background
* Removed anti-aliasing from enemies
* Lowered the volume across the board for sound effects and music
* Changed the background music
